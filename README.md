# Image Generation Project

This project allows for the generation of images using open-source AI models set up on a serverless platform. By leveraging ComfyUI, Docker, RunPod, Python, React, JavaScript, and n8n, this project provides an efficient and scalable solution for automated image generation.

## Features

- **AI-Driven Image Generation**: Utilize open-source AI models to generate high-quality images based on specified prompts and parameters.
- **Serverless Architecture**: Reduce costs and optimize resource usage by deploying the model on a serverless platform, spinning up resources only when required.
- **Automation and Workflow Management**: Use n8n to automate the generation process, enabling custom workflows that trigger image creation, processing, and storage.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A front-end application built with React and JavaScript provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the AI models and view generated images.

## Technologies Used

- **[ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)**: Provides a user-friendly UI for interacting with AI models, allowing for fine-tuned control over image generation settings.
- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com)**: Containerizes the application to ensure consistent environments, making deployment and scaling easier and more reliable.
- **[RunPod](https://www.runpod.io)**: Serverless GPU-based platform used for on-demand AI model execution, optimizing costs by only running when actively generating images.
- **[Python](https://www.python.org)**: The primary backend language used to interact with AI models, manage workflows, and integrate various components of the image generation process.
- **[React](https://reactjs.org)**: Front-end library for building the user interface where users can interact with the image generation platform.
- **JavaScript**: Used in conjunction with React for dynamic, interactive, and responsive front-end development.
- **[n8n](https://n8n.io)**: Workflow automation tool that orchestrates the image generation pipeline, managing tasks like prompt input, model selection, and image output.
